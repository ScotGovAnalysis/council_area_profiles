Council Area Profiles

Rmarkdown to generate demographic profiles for each Scottish Council
area.

## How it works

For each council area we create: data, plots, tables, and text. These
elements are then knitted into an HTML document by an RMarkdown file.
The whole process is controlled by a single script that loops over each
council area.

## How to update

1. Save a copy of the most recent files to a local drive (RMarkdown will knit faster in a local drive)
2. Update the data file (including data and last/next updates)
3. Check you’re using the latest dataset and only the updated datasets have changed
4. Check all the 'next update' dates are still in the future
5. Update links to source tables
6. Run the script that loops over each council area (this normally takes around 20 mins)
7. Sense check the HTML document
8. Send a sample of HTML documents to the relevant Statistician for checking
9. Send all HTML documents to the web team to upload to the website
10. Set a reminder for the next update
11. **After publication** upload changes to GitHub
12. Delete old local copies of the code

## Who owns each tab
Household Estimates and Projections:

Vital Events:
- Births by sex
- Standardised birth rates
- Births by age of mother
- Fertility rates
- Deaths by sex
- Standardised death rates
- Deaths by sex by age
- Leading causes of death
- Life expectancy
- Marriages
- Civil partnerships

Population and Migration Statistics:
- All other tabs

## Room for improvement

In rough order of importance/urgency:

  - Validate data before preparing tables (e.g. is every council area included? Should Scotland be included? Are all combinations of all variables included? Are values sensible e.g. age < 120?)
  - Simplify the code. For example:
      - Replace deeply nested `ifelse` with `case_when` or `switch` statements
      - Use functions and apply
        [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
      - Use [existing
        utilities](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/label_ordinal.html)
  - Reduce the time it takes to run
      - This may be because some datasets are very large
      - A solution could be to create aggregate versions of a single
        dataset
  - Improve/shorten variable names
  - Improve comments (e.g. **why** not **what**)
  - Nest/tidy datasets so the environment is more managable
  - Fix Y axis on fertility plot
